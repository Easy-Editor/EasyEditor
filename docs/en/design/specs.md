# Protocol Stack

::: tip
We are currently working on protocol stack documentation specific to EasyEditor. Stay tuned!
:::

::: info
EasyEditor is based on [lowcode-engine](https://github.com/alibaba/lowcode-engine) with modifications and extensions, though the core functionality remains similar.

You can refer to the [lowcode-engine protocol stack documentation](https://lowcode-engine.cn/site/docs/guide/design/specs) in the meantime.
