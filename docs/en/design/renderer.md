# Renderer Module

::: tip
We are currently working on renderer module documentation specific to EasyEditor. Stay tuned!
:::

::: info
EasyEditor is based on [lowcode-engine](https://github.com/alibaba/lowcode-engine) with modifications and extensions, though the core functionality remains similar.

You can refer to the [lowcode-engine renderer module documentation](https://lowcode-engine.cn/site/docs/guide/design/renderer) in the meantime.
