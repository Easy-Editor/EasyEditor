# Why Choose EasyEditor?

## What is EasyEditor?

EasyEditor is a pluggable cross-framework low-code engine that provides a complete visual design system and flexible plugin architecture. Through simple drag-and-drop operations, you can quickly build applications while supporting multi-framework rendering extensions like React, Vue, and more. It not only offers enterprise-grade features but also provides high customizability, allowing developers to create tailored low-code platforms according to their specific needs.

## Core Advantages

- **Plugin Architecture**: Highly extensible plugin system for easy core functionality expansion
- **Cross-Framework Support**: Supports multiple frontend frameworks including React, Vue, and more
- **Multi-Scenario Adaptation**: Professional solutions for dashboard, form, portal, and other scenarios
- **Protocol-Driven**: Unified low-code protocol standards for cross-platform interoperability
- **High-Performance Design**: Optimized for large-scale application scenarios with ensured rendering performance

## Use Cases

EasyEditor is suitable for various application scenarios:

- **Data Visualization Dashboards**: Quickly build various data dashboards through drag-and-drop
- **Enterprise Form Systems**: Build complex business forms with support for validation, linkage, and other advanced features
- **Enterprise Portal Development**: Rapidly build internal and external enterprise portal websites
- **Workflow Systems**: Visually design workflows and integrate with forms and other systems

## Project Motivation

EasyEditor draws inspiration from the low-code engine designed within our company and [lowcode-engine](https://github.com/alibaba/lowcode-engine). We have extended the original specifications to support multiple rendering methods, not limited to forms, but also including dashboards, portals, and workflows.

During our research of multiple low-code projects, we found that while lowcode-engine provides excellent protocol standards, certain scenarios still require more flexible and lightweight solutions, especially for supporting non-form applications.

## Differences Between EasyEditor and lowcode-engine

### Key Differences

| Feature | EasyEditor | lowcode-engine |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Core Design** | Focused on core protocols, lightweight engine | Complete ecosystem |
| **Application Scope** | Multi-scenario (dashboard, form, portal, etc.) | Mainly focused on form applications |
| **Extension Method** | Plugin-based, highly customizable | Plugin system, but with lower customization freedom |
| **Learning Curve** | Lightweight and easy to master | Complete but with higher learning cost |
| **Framework Support** | Designed to support multi-framework rendering | Mainly based on React ecosystem |

### Design Philosophy

lowcode-engine provides a complete system including pages, renderers, configuration panels, etc., which is very convenient to install and use. However, when users need to add additional content, they may face higher learning costs and usage difficulties. For example, disabling the system's built-in shortcuts may require in-depth understanding of APIs.

In contrast, EasyEditor focuses on core protocol standards, aiming to achieve interoperability between different frameworks and devices. Through plugins and renderers, we can flexibly implement rendering for various application types, reducing user costs and allowing users to have complete control over page design, easily implementing different UIs.
